We found this project to be quite demanding while still being within our reach.
Of all the requested features only the "Help" in cwcreator did we find to be overwhelming and were not able to implement. This comes from the fact that
we were also unable to implement the function "wildcard" in the previous Project. Apart from that, the "remove" feature also presented some challenges, but we 
managed to overcome those. Inserting the colours was also a handful even despite the code being given to us.

We also recognize the likelyhood that the program might be "buggy" in some "edge"-cases, but we did try to "foolproof" as best we could.
